# OOP 
## PhotoAlbum

* Create a class "PhotoAlbum" with a private attribute "numberOfPages."

* It should also have a public method "GetNumberOfPages", which will return the number of pages.

* The default constructor will create an album with 16 pages. There will be an additional constructor, with which we can specify the number of pages we want in the album.

* Create a class "BigPhotoAlbum" whose constructor will create an album with 64 pages.

* Create a test class "AlbumTest" to create an album with its default constructor, one with 24 pages, a "BigPhotoAlbum" and show the number of pages that the three albums have.


## Classes Student + Teacher

* Create a new project, and include in it the class Person that you just created.
* Create a class "Student" and another class "Teacher", both descendants of "Person".
* The class "Student" will have a public method "GoToClasses", which will write on screen "Iâ€™m going to class."
* The class "Teacher" will have a public method "Explain", which will show on screen "Explanation begins". Also, it will have a private attribute "subject", a string.
* The class Person must have a method "SetAge (int n)" which will indicate the value of their age (eg, 20 years old).
* The student will have a public method "ShowAge" which will write on the screen "My age is: 20 years old" (or the corresponding number).
* You must create another test class called "StudentAndTeacherTest" that will contain "Main" and:
  1. Create a Person and make it say hello

  2. Create a student, set his age to 21, tell him to Greet and display his age

  3. Create a teacher, 30 years old, ask him to say hello and then explain.


## Write C# program to 
Define interface that 2 method:
```cs
AccountInfo() //return info;
Process() //process data;
```
Implements the interface just defined
only need to mock the data no need to implement the code

Then call in the Main()

## Write C# program to 
This program mock the use case when connect to the database then user do some transaction. Define interface that method:
```cs
StartTransaction()
```

Then implement the interface with the class then call in the Main()
